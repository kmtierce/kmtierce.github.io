		<p class="headline">About Emitt</p>
		<p class="pcopy">
			Born in Tucson, Arizona in 1950, I was an Air Force brat, moving every 2-3 years until 1966. I've lived in Arizona, Illinois, Morocco, England, Texas, Illinois (yep, twice), and Mississippi.<br /><br />

			In the summer of 1963, I worked an entire summer as a grocery bagger to purchase my first guitar from Sears for $37. In 1966, I joined my first band, Take Five, providing rhythm guitar and backing vocals. Later that year, I formed my first group, Hastings Playhouse, with my brother Bill serving as the manager.<br /><br />

			Not long after, another local group, Substantial Evidence, recruited me as rhythm/lead guitar and vocalist, and I eventually became their primary songwriter. In 1968, I was stolen away by another established local group, Flower Power, for rhythm guitar and backup vocals. We performed together until the 1969 New Orleans Pop Festival, where we shared a stage with such greats as Santana, Chicago, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix,<br /><br />

			From 1968 to 1971, I did short stints with Third Estate, Amber, and Teddy &amp; the Rockets while I continued to refine my songwriting.<br /><br />

			In 1971, I reunited with former Substantial Evidence members to form Itchie Brother. This was where original material and performance really began for me, and I've been playing in bands and writing music ever since.<br /><br />
